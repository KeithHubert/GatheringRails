# Gathering

My project “Gathering” is a web app that allows people that play the card game Magic the Gathering to meet other players and find local games. Once registered, users sign into the website and are greeted with the map page. The map page displays an interactive Google Map that shows where games have been added as well as a tile that shows the five most recently added games to the database. From here a user can search all games that have been added to the database, check game information by clicking on location markers on the Google Map or create their own game. The game creator can edit their game information, leave a comment in the comment field, view games that they are hosting or joined, as well as permit other users to join their game or add them manually. Visitors to another user’s gamepage can view game information as well as request to join the game. They can also communicate with the host and other users through the comment board or send a private message. From this page, visitors also have access to their list of joined/hosted games. The top-bar provides links for users to travel from the map page to their profile page or conversations page. The conversations page shows messages that have been sent to the user as well as a user list to initiate new conversations.

As a Magic the Gathering player, I always wished that a site like this had existed so that I could network with local gamers. Creating the site has been a great learning experience and I have enjoyed working on it.
